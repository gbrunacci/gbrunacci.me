# Personal Home Page

Welcome to my Persona Home page.

This site has been build using create-react-app using typescript template.

CSS is applied via Styled Components.

Code style assured with Prettier.

As there is only one route, no need for react router yet.

As there is no global app object, no need for redux.

Just trying to keep this page simple and readable.

## Some useful commands

Not sure why you would want to clone my personal repo, but I do :)

npm start
